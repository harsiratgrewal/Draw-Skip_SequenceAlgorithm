## Algorithm to create a sequence for draw-skip function
### Draw-Skip Function
#### In an array, the draw skip function draws one element and skips (queues to same array) the next element. 
### Draw-Skip Mechanism



#### This algorithm creates a sequence for elements ranging 1-n, where n is any positive natural number. This sequence is sorted once run through the draw-skip function.
